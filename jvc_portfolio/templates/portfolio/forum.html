                    The home page for the forum displays all topics sorted by date of creation by default, with the option to change sorting order. I included a sample banner on the main forum page to showcase how any ads, information or even static styles can be added, placed, and moved around to suit a multitude of uses. The team also wanted users to be able to create and filter posts for a variety of topics, so I implemented a sidebar to display available topics, as well as a form for admin to create new topics as needed.

The list display then provides a link to 'Read More' that directs user to the specified post's detail page. On the detail page, users can like the post, comment on the post and reply to previous comments. In addition to being able to read any post, authenticated users have the ability to update, edit, and deletee posts that they created. These features can be accessed via links on the post list or post detail pages.

            In order to maintain a clean and seemless user experience, I opted to include the post creation form, along with the comment and reply forms direclty on the web page. When the page is initially loaded, the forms are hidden using JavaScript and only displayed when a user clicks the corresponding button.
